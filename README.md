# Photogram Associations

In this project, we'll re-write our association accessor methods using [ActiveRecord's powerful Association helpers](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html).

There are no automated tests; this is just for practice. Play around in the `rails console` as you make changes to ensure that the changes you are making are having the desired effects.

Use this tool to help plan out your new association methods:

Note that the above tool doesn't yet support Scoped Associations. As a stretch goal, [read up on them here](https://remimercier.com/scoped-active-record-associations/) and see if you can figure out how to use them to build `accepted_sent_friend_requests`, `leaders`, `feed`, and `discover`.
